# PyLinkedin
 Made a bot  for Linkedin using Selenium (v1.0)

To run the script, you must have some requirements done:

-Install python (Python 3.7.3 at least)

-Install Selenium package with the command PIP (pip install selenium)

-Install the driver for your browser. There are different type of driver depending on what browser you are using. You can use the Selenium documentation(https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)

This version of the script works only if your Linkedin account is fully completed. This is only the version 1.0 so it may have some bugs depending on what browser your are using. (For my example, I use a specific driver for Chrome).

Enjoy it ! And if you have some questions or issues, I'm available on Linkedin (LÃ©o Delpon)
